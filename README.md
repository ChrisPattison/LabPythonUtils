# PythonUtils
Unpolished random Python utilities I've written to do stuff

Most of these have hardcodes and PyVISA scripts must have the test instrument ID changed to that of the instrument used

curve_tracer - Curve tracer using an HP E3631

error - Mumerically propogates error in an arbitrary function

bode - Makes a bode plot of a circuit using a Tektronix TDS1002B and Stanford Research Systems DS345 takes 7.5s per data point.

bode_err - Plots output of bode and theoretical values of an LRC circuit
